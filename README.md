# Culinary-PlanWise
Culinary PlanWise is an iOS application developed as part of a bachelorâ€™s thesis. Its main goal is to simplify meal planning by generating personalized weekly menus based on user-provided data. The app takes into account dietary preferences, nutritional values, and allergy information to create balanced and tailored meal plans.

Key Features
- Personalization: Meal plans are tailored to individual user needs, ensuring a healthier and more convenient approach to eating.
- Nutritional Awareness: Provides insights into nutritional values to support informed dietary choices.
- Allergy Considerations: Carefully adapts plans to exclude ingredients based on user allergies.

Technology Stack
The app leverages modern technologies for a seamless user experience:

- React Native for cross-platform development (now just iOS).
- TypeScript and JavaScript for robust and maintainable code.
- Firebase for user authentication, real-time data management, and cloud storage.

This project serves as a demonstration of practical problem-solving in software development, combining technical expertise with user-centric design to address real-world challenges in meal planning and nutrition.
